# BOLA Automation

**Python scripts for performing BOLA vulnerability testing. Using these scripts we will find all types of points in the API and perform CRUD operations on vulnerable endpoints (phase1_bola_verification.py / once we find the vulnerable end point we will perform CRUD operations)**

##  Usage

```bash
python3 phase1.py     # Find vulns
python3 phase2.py userlist2  # Attack
