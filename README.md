# BOLA Automation

**Python scripts for performing BOLA vulnerability testing. Using these scripts we will find all types of points in the API and perform CRUD operations on vulnerable endpoints (phase1_bola_verification.py / once we find the vulnerable end point we will perform CRUD operations)**

##  Usage

```bash
python3 bola_verification.py     # Find vulns
python3 bola_crud.py VULN_ENDPOINT_NAME  # Attack
